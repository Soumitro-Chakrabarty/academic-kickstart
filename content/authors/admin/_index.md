I currently work as a Senior Scientist in the Communication Acoustics group at [Fraunhofer IIS](https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en.html). My current research interests are in the field of machine learning for signal processing, mainly focused on speech separation and enhancement as well as microphone array signal processing. I am mainly involved in developing AI/ML based acoustic front-end processing technologies for [Fraunhofer upHearÂ® Voice Quality Enhancement](https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en/ff/amm/communication/uphear-vqe.html).   

Prior to this, I was a research and teaching assistant at [AudioLabs](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/), and a PhD student at FAU Erlangen. The focus of my PhD work was on robust spatial filtering and sound source localization in noisy and reverberant environments with a focus on deep learning based method in the later part of my PhD work.
